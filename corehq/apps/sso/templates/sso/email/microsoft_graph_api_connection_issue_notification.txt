Dear enterprise administrator,

There was an issue connecting to the Microsoft Graph API when running a task to
deactivate SSO Web Users on CommCare HQ that have been removed from your Microsoft Entra ID Enterprise Application.

This was the error message:
{{ error }}

Please check the configuration of the Remote User Management settings in your Identity Provider.

If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact {{ contact_email }}.
Thank you for your use and support of CommCare.

Best regards,

The CommCare HQ Team

Dear enterprise administrator,

We have temporarily skipped automatic deactivate of SSO Web Users
because we are receiving an empty list of users from your Microsoft Entra ID instance.

Please check the configuration of the Remote User Management settings in your Identity Provider.

If you have any questions, or if this issue persists, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact {{ contact_email }}.
Thank you for your use and support of CommCare.

Best regards,

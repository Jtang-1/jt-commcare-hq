Dear enterprise administrator,

We have temporarily skipped automatic deactivation of SSO-managed Web Users
because we are receiving an empty list of users from your Microsoft Entra ID instance.

Please check the configuration for Remote User Management in your Identity Provider settings.

If you have any questions, or if this issue persists, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact {{ contact_email }}.
Thank you for your use and support of CommCare.

Best regards,

The CommCare HQ Team
